# Monoprice MP Mini Delta
Klipper config files for my MPMD.

Things to keep in mind if you want to use this as a reference.
 - Mainboard is a SKR MINI E3 V1.2
 - Screen is a BIGTREETECH TFT35 V3.0.  [You need special firmware for that screen so it works with Klipper](https://github.com/teeminus/NoTouchScreenFirmware)
 - SEEMECNC EZR STRUDER
 - 0.25mm nozzle
